	The CMake build system has been added. CMake generates project's native build files.
	One of nice features of CMake is it's 'out of source' build option - using it does not
	clutter the source tree with build output. The best way to use it:

	# in this (root) directory:
	mkdir build		# build directory is alredy added to svn ignore
	cd build
	cmake ..		# this will generate the build files
